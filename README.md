**Abstract**
This experiment intends to answer the question, “Can the most optimized positioning of water molecules in a multidimensional system, in order to reach the lowest possible system energy, be created by randomly generated simulations?” The hypothesis that the most optimized system can be generated via simulation after initial randomized placement of water molecules will be accepted if the data returned from the program is comparable and realistic data, in comparison to a real system of interacting water molecules. The hypothesis will be rejected if the program is mathematically incapable of producing a system close to minimal system energy. Minimal system energy will be determined by the angle of the individual water molecules and their distances apart from one another. The total energy of the system will then be calculated by taking the summation of the individual iterations of Columb Energy between each atom of each water molecule in the system. Columb Energy will be calculated through looping processes and dipole moment interaction algorithms.
